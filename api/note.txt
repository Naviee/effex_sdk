The resource files:

fx_base.h
fx_base_constraints.h
fx_constraint.h
fx_force_base.h
fx_force_plugin.h
fx_operator_plugin.h

These are the same as the ones in the Effex plugin´s description resource folder (..plugins/Navie Effex/res/description)
so you could also simply add that folder path to the project settings include path (instead of adding them to the project).
